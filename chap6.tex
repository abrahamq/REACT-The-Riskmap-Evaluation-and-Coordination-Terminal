\chapter{Conclusion}

Now that the REACT System has been built and trained it can be used as a
detection tool to help EOCs find the reports that are most likely to indicate
`heavy flooding'. The REACT System sets itself apart from other disaster
management systems because it is modular and adaptable to new data streams.
Furthermore, the use of machine learning as a service technologies allows REACT
to be less impacted by the cold start problem at the beginning of disasters and
also means that the system will improve as those services improve. As global
climate change continues to increase the frequency and severity of disaster events
in, it will become more and more important for EOCs to use all the tools at
their disposal to make sense of the large amounts of data available.
