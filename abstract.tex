The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) states that economic losses
due to natural disasters have risen 151 percent in the past 20 years. Of these 
disasters, floods are the most common. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 
was created by the UNDRR in order to chart goals for future risk mitigation; among its 
seven global targets is increasing the availability of disaster risk information 
and assessment systems. Disaster information systems use state of the art techniques such as 
remote sensing in order to mitigate damages from natural and man made hazards. 

More developed countries utilize networks of advanced sensors and
ahead of time mapping in order to facilitate emergency responses;
however, such systems are not available in developing countries due to cost limitations.
The widespread proliferation of smart phones and social media use among even those in 
developing countries means that citizens can be used as sensors by reporting 
disaster information online. The Riskmap system is one such system developed by the 
MIT Urban Risk Lab in order to gather citizen reports. Such citizen disaster
reports have two issues: 
a large influx of reports can cause information overload in emergency 
operations centers and make it difficult to summarize the situation. Machine 
learning has been used in order to analyze and simplify information for 
human consumption. This work seeks to use novel machine learning
techniques to fully utilize crowdsourced social media reports gathered
using the Riskmap system.

    This work establishes the motivation for using
citizens as sensors and analyzing this noisy data using machine learning. It also
reviews different machine learning techniques for disaster mitigation. Finally
a novel ensemble learning model is presented that can accurately predict large
flood events from crowdsourced data.
