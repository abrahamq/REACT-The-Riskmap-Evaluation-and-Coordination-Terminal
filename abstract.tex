Disaster information systems use state of the art techniques in order 
to mitigate damages from natural and man made hazards. 
Developed countries utilize networks of advanced sensors and 
ahead of time mapping in order to facilitate emergency responses; 
however, such systems are not available in developing countries, which face 
the highest risk from disasters. This work seeks to use novel machine learning 
techniques to fully utilize crowdsourced social media reports gathered 
using the Riskmap system. This work establishes the motivation for using 
citizens as sensors and analyzing this noisy data using machine learning. It also 
reviews different machine learning techniques for disaster mitigation. Finally 
a novel ensemble learning model is presented that can accurately predict large 
flood events from crowdsourced data.
