\section{Individual}
\subsection{Image Data}
\subsubsection{Using transfer learning}
As the time goes on and the Riskmap System registers more flood events, 
more data will be collected. One possible method that is not explored in this
work is the use of transfer learning inside of an image classifier neural
network as in~\cite{donahueDeCAFDeepConvolutional2013}.
\subsection{Text Data}
\subsubsection{word2vec}
As outlined previously, we did not experiment with word2vec embeddings because
of the difficulty of handling multi language datasets; however, it would be
possible to create a word2vec embedder for Indonesian by using publicly
available texts such as Wikipedia.

\section{Bagging}
\subsection{Bigger network}
Our current bagging network is very small so as to reduce over fitting on the
small datasets we currently have. As the Riskmap System collects more data, it
is likely that we can use a larger network with a decreased risk of over fitting.
