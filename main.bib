  abstract = {Asia's urbanized mega-deltas are experiencing increased incidences of flooding. Flood risk is increasing due to urban growth, which makes people more vulnerable and threatens economic assets, and due to factors that increase flood hazard, including reduced delta aggradation, subsidence though natural resource extraction, and climate change, including extreme weather events, such as typhoons, and sea level rise. The recent history of flooding in Asia's deltaic cities and the drivers of that risk have been examined in this article. We give particular attention to the Pearl River Delta, and its cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, important economic centres of Asia. The flood risk is substantial, but flood risk management appear to suffer through a lack of sufficient strategic planning, and the difficulty of defending deltaic cities through traditional engineering approaches alone. Drawing on lessons from flood risk management internationally, we suggest that there are ways forward in developing flood mitigation strategies for deltaic cities in the region, which deserve further exploration.},

  abstract = {Disaster Management (DM) is a complex set of interrelated activities. The activities are often knowledge intensive and time sensitive. Sharing the required knowledge timely is critical for DM. In developed countries, for recurring disasters (e.g. floods), there are dedicated document repositories of Disaster Management Plans (DMP) that can be accessed as needs arise. However, accessing the appropriate plan in a timely manner and sharing activities between plans often requires domain knowledge and intimate knowledge of the plans in the first place. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based knowledge analysis method to convert DMPs into a collection of knowledge units that can be stored into a unified repository. The repository of DM actions then enables the mixing and matching knowledge between different plans. The repository is structured as a layered abstraction according to Meta Object Facility (MOF). We use the flood management plans used by SES in NSW to illustrate and give a preliminary validation of the approach. It is illustrated using DMPs along the flood prone Murrumbidgee River in central NSW.},

@phdthesis{yangUrbanFloodSimulation,
  title = {Urban {{Flood Simulation}} and {{Integrated Flood Risk Management}}},
  abstract = {Climate change induces the probability of occurring natural disasters; e.g.
floods, Sea Level Rise, Green House Gases. Flood is considered one of the
most dangerous phenomena that tremendously and dramatically threatening
the human being and environment worldwide. Rapid urban growth,
demographic explosion, and unplanned land uses have exacerbated the
problem of urban flooding, particularly in the cities of China. In addition to that,
the concept of flood risk management and adaptation measures and strategies
are still missed in the cities' development future plans.
The main objective of this Ph.D. dissertation is to investigate the flood risk
analysis and assessment based on flood simulation and adaptive strategies for
flood event through two case studies of Changsha city in south-central China.
In case study I, fluvial flooding was considered on mesoscale and an MCAbased
approach was proposed to assess the integrated flood risk of Changsha
central city. HEC-RAS 1-D model was used to simulation the inundation
characteristics for hazard analysis based on four risk dimensions: economic,
social, environmental, and infrastructural risk. For infrastructural dimension,
apart for direct damage on road segments, network analysis method was
combined with inundation information and macroscopic traffic simulation to
evaluate the impact on traffic volume as well as a decrease of road service level.
Closeness centrality weighted with a travel time of pre- and after- flood was
compared in order to measure the impact on urban accessibility. Integrated risk
values were calculated using various weighting criteria sets. Sobol' indices were
used as a tool of spatially-explicit global Uncertainty Analysis and Sensitivity
Analysis (UA/SA) for damage models.
In case study II, an agent-based modeling approach was proposed to simulate
the emergency pluvial flood event caused by a short-time rainstorm in local
areas of cities aiming at developing an interactive flood emergency
management system capable of interpreting the risk and reduction strategy of
the pluvial flood. The simulation integrated an inundation model with
microscopic traffic simulation. It also reveals that all agents can benefit
significantly from both engineering measures and the only pedestrian obtain
relatively more benefits from risk warning with high awareness. The method
provided potentials in studies on the adaptive emergency management and risk
reduction, help both decision-makers and stakeholders to acquire deeper and
comprehensive understanding of the flood risk.
IV
This Ph.D. study has investigated holistic methods and models' selection in
flood risk assessment and management to overcome data deficiency and to
achieve the integration of different data. The results of the first case study reveal
that the integrated methods have proved to be able to improved flood risk
analysis and assessment especially for indirect damage of infrastructural
system with network features. The global UA/SA based on Sobol' method and
visualization with maps enable to gain the spatial distribution of uncertainty for
various factors, the validation of damage models, and deeper and more
comprehensive understanding of flood risk. Then based on the integrated risk
assessment, functions of spatial planning in flood risk management were
discussed, potentially providing guidance and support for decision-making.
The results of the second case study denote that agent-based modeling and
simulation can be effectively utilized for flood emergency management. Two
scenarios focusing on specific risk reduction interventions were designed and
compared. Engineering measures by improving capability of the drainage
system and the surface permeability of waterlogging areas are the most
effective means for damage mitigation. High public risk awareness still has
great potential benefits of the in the event of emergencies, which can greatly
enhance the effectiveness of the official warning. The agent-based modeling
and simulation provided an effective method for analyzing the effectiveness of
different strategies for reducing flood risk at the local scale and for supporting
urban flood emergency management. The case studies also indicate the
significance and necessity of establishing a platform and database to realize
full sharing and synergies of spatial information resources for flood risk
management, which is a vital issue to manage the urban flood risk and take
effective measures correspondingly with responding to emergency extreme
flood event.},

The authors explore how these findings can improve disaster programs, identify remaining research needs, and discuss disaster within the broader context of sustainable development.How do different people think about disaster? Are we more likely to panic or to respond with altruism? Why are 110 people killed in a Valujet crash considered disaster victims while the 50,000 killed annually in traffic accidents in the U.S. are not? At the crossroads of social, cultural, and economic factors, this book examines these and other compelling questions.The authors review the influences that shape the U.S. governmental system for disaster planning and response, the effectiveness of local emergency agencies, and the level of professionalism in the field. They also compare technological versus natural disaster and examine the impact of technology on disaster programs.},

  abstract = {Many coastal cities are experiencing growing risk to hydrological hazards through the combination of uncontrolled urban development and exposure to natural phenomena linked to climate change, including rising sea levels, intensified storms, and amplified storm surges. This growing risk is particularly acute in Asian coastal mega-cities, many of which have yet to develop adequate adaptation policies to address plausible impacts of climate change. In this analysis, we review how Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the most affluent coastal cities in East Asia, have initiated many flood mitigation strategies policies that have allowed them to reduce the impacts flooding. These strategies, once relying largely on building flood control structures, have now evolved to include holistic flood risk management approaches that include socio-economic factors. Arguably these two success stories provide inspiration for other coastal Asian cities. However, as climate change and uncontrolled development are likely to increase urban flooding in the future, general improvements could be made to improve knowledge transfer: e.g., develop means to work across policy silos and strike compromises between conflicting sectoral responsibilities, and develop long-term integrated strategies using planning tools and practices to address growing risk. While knowledge transfer cannot be direct because of different geographical settings, socio-economic situations, and political situations, we encourage governments to look beyond engineering-based flood control structures as to develop flood governance programs.},

Professionals associated with disaster management and climate change are at the forefront of addressing urban flooding. To reduce flood risks, vulnerability and its components must be understood. Vulnerability assessment methods are diverse and complex, with a varied nature of understanding the key terms used in various contexts, and this diversity ultimately reflects on the interpretation of results in research settings. Diverse interpretations and definitions exist in the disaster risk and climate change literature, complicating the process of astute and comprehensive vulnerability assessment. The main purpose of this study was to quantify vulnerability indicators and develop a multidimensional model for vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability is explored through the lens of five dimensions: social, economic, physical/infrastructural, institutional, and attitudinal. This methodology is applied to urban flooding in Pakistan, to verify the proposed model. Three study sites in urban areas with different population sizes, situated in high-risk flood zones in the Punjab Province of Pakistan were selected for empirical investigation. A household survey was conducted, and indices were developed for each dimension based on well-defined indicators. The proposed methodology for vulnerability assessment was tested and found operational. This method can be replicated irrespective of spatial scales and can be modified for other disasters by streamlining hazard specific indicators.},

  abstract = {During major disasters, at what point in the decisional process do senior government officials transition from developing necessary situational awareness to perform decision making? This ``transition to decision making'' (TDM) concept was analyzed through a structured interview survey of 25 current and former US Federal Coordinating Officers (FCOs) and focused on their decision-making process during the initial response period in a Presidentially declared Stafford Act disaster. This analysis suggests that the TDM for these emergency leaders is influenced by the following five factors: 1) Analogue Factor: the decision maker's previous knowledge and experience from analogous disaster situations; 2) New Paradigm Factor: the degree to which the disaster situation is very atypical to the decision maker due to hazard type and/or situation severity, 3) Data Capture Factor: the quality, amount, and speed of disaster situation data conveyed to the decision maker; 4) Data Integration Factor: the decision maker's ability to integrate situational data elements into a mental framework/picture; and 5) Time Urgency Factor: the decision maker's perception as to time available before a decision has to be made. The article describes the factors and graphs that how these may influence the timing of the TDM in four types of emergency situations faced by FCOs: 1) an analogue disaster, 2) a disaster situation that presents a new paradigm, 3) an intuitive disaster situation, and 4) a disaster requiring an urgent response.},

We concentrate on such savings in the context of response to false calls to police, fire, and ambulance services. Solving the false alarm problem for police, fire, and ambulance services and eliminating some non-public-good police services could release significant service-hours and 23.7-31.4\% of the required additional Homeland Security (HLS) annual spending. Reducing false alarms means 88,000 police, fire, and ambulance first responders could be shifted to HLS activities.},

As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: handling information overload, filtering credible information, and prioritizing different classes of messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages, focusing on their application in emergency response scenarios. We examine the particularities of this setting, and then methodically examine a series of key sub-problems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries.},

  abstract = {Automatic environmental monitoring networks enforced by wireless communication technologies provide large and ever increasing
volumes of data nowadays. The use of this information in natural hazard research is an important issue. Particularly useful
for risk assessment and decision making are the spatial maps of hazard-related parameters produced from point observations
and available auxiliary information. The purpose of this article is to present and explore the appropriate tools to process
large amounts of available data and produce predictions at fine spatial scales. These are the algorithms of machine learning,
which are aimed at non-parametric robust modelling of non-linear dependencies from empirical data. The computational efficiency
of the data-driven methods allows producing the prediction maps in real time which makes them superior to physical models
for the operational use in risk assessment and mitigation. Particularly, this situation encounters in spatial prediction of
climatic variables (topo-climatic mapping). In complex topographies of the mountainous regions, the meteorological processes
are highly influenced by the relief. The article shows how these relations, possibly regionalized and non-linear, can be modelled
from data using the information from digital elevation models. The particular illustration of the developed methodology concerns
the mapping of temperatures (including the situations of F{\"o}hn and temperature inversion) given the measurements taken from
the Swiss meteorological monitoring network. The range of the methods used in the study includes data-driven feature selection,
support vector algorithms and artificial neural networks.},

We begin by describing the concept of Social Media, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and User Generated Content. Based on this definition, we then provide a classification of Social Media which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into more specific categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds. Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social Media.},

The new framework incorporates Box\textendash{}Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.},

This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

Damage assessment during disasters is a core situational awareness task for many humanitarian organizations that traditionally takes weeks and months. In this work, we analyze images posted on social media platforms during natural disasters to determine the level of damage caused by the disasters. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to perform an extensive experimentation of damage assessment using images from four major natural disasters. We show that the domain-specific fine-tuning of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques such as Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW). High classification accuracy under both event-specific and cross-event test settings demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively adapt deep-CNN features to identify the severity of destruction from social media images taken after a disaster strikes.},

Data produced through social networking sites is seen as ubiquitous, rapid and accessible, and it is believed to empower average citizens to become more situationally aware during disasters and coordinate to help themselves. However, with the exponential increase in the volume of social media data, so comes the increase in data that are irrelevant to a disaster, thus, diminishing peoples' ability to find the information that they need in order to organize relief efforts, find help, and potentially save lives. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying informative messages in social media streams during disaster events. Our approach is based on Convolutional Neural Networks and shows significant improvement in performance over models that use the ``bag of words'' and n-grams as features on several datasets of messages from flooding events.},

Data is processed instantly requiring the learning machinery to (self-)adapt by adjusting its model. However for high velocity streams, it is usually difficult to obtain labeled samples to train the classification model. Hence, we propose a novel online batch-based active learning algorithm (OBAL) to perform the labeling. OBAL is developed for crisis management applications where data streams are generated by the social media community. OBAL is applied to discriminate relevant from irrelevant social media items. An emergency management user will be interactively queried to label chosen items. OBAL exploits the boundary items for which it is highly uncertain about their class and makes use of two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). OBAL is equipped with a labeling budget and a set of uncertainty strategies to identify the items for labeling. An extensive analysis is carried out to show OBAL's performance, the sensitivity of its parameters, and the contribution of the individual uncertainty strategies. Two types of datasets are used: synthetic and social media datasets related to crises. The empirical results illustrate that OBAL has a very good discrimination power.},

This information can be used to detect rapidly the sentiment of the crowd towards crises or disasters. It can be used as an effective tool to inform humanitarian efforts, and improve the ways in which informative messages are crafted for the crowd regarding an event. Unique characteristics of microblogs (lack of context, use of jargon etc) in Tweets expressed by a message-sharing social network during a disaster response require special handling to identify sentiment. We present a systematic evaluation of approaches to accurately and precisely identify sentiment in these Tweets. This paper describes sentiment detection expressed in 3698 Tweets, collected during the September 2010, San Bruno, California gas explosion and resulting fires. The data collected was manually coded to benchmark our techniques. We start by using a library of words with annotated sentiment, SentiWordNet 3.0, to detect the basic sentiment of each Tweet. We complemented that technique by adding a comprehensive list of emoticons, a sentiment based dictionary and a list of out-of-vocabulary words that are popular in brief, online text communications such as lol, wow, etc. Our technique performed 27\% better than Bayesian Networks alone, and the combination of Bayesian networks with annotated lists provided marginal improvements in sentiment detection than various combinations of lists.},

  abstract = {Microblogging platforms such as Twitter provide active communication channels during mass convergence and emergency events such as earthquakes, typhoons. During the sudden onset of a crisis situation, affected people post useful information on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other humanitarian disaster response efforts, if processed timely and effectively. Processing social media information pose multiple challenges such as parsing noisy, brief and informal messages, learning information categories from the incoming stream of messages and classifying them into different classes among others. One of the basic necessities of many of these tasks is the availability of data, in particular human-annotated data. In this paper, we present human-annotated Twitter corpora collected during 19 different crises that took place between 2013 and 2015. To demonstrate the utility of the annotations, we train machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we publish first largest word2vec word embeddings trained on 52 million crisis-related tweets. To deal with tweets language issues, we present human-annotated normalized lexical resources for different lexical variations.},

  abstract = {Social media has recently become a digital lifeline used to relay information and locate survivors in disaster situations. Currently, officials and volunteers scour social media for any valuable information; however, this approach is implausible as millions of posts are shared by the minute. Our goal is to automate actionable information extraction from social media posts to efficiently direct relief resources. Identifying damage and human casualties allows first responders to efficiently allocate resources and save as many lives as possible. Since social media posts contain text, images and videos, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework to identify damage related information. This framework combines multiple pretrained unimodal convolutional neural networks that extract features from raw text and images independently, before a final classifier labels the posts based on both modalities. Experiments on a home-grown database of labeled social media posts showed promising results and validated the merits of the proposed approach.},

While most of the efforts in such humanitarian situations rely heavily on human labor and input, we propose in this paper a novel hybrid approach to help automate more humanitarian computing. Our framework merges low-level visual features that extract color, shape and texture along with a semantic attribute that is obtained after comparing the picture annotation to some bag of words. These visual and textual features were trained and tested on a dataset gathered from the SUN database and some Google Images. The best accuracy obtained using low-level features alone is 91.3 \%, while appending the semantic attributes to it raised the accuracy to 95.5\% using linear SVM and 5-Fold cross-validation which motivates an updated folk statement "an ANNOTATED image is worth a thousand word ".},

Studies have revealed that this online information, if processed timely and effectively, is extremely useful for humanitarian organizations to gain situational awareness and plan relief operations. In addition to the analysis of textual content, recent studies have shown that imagery content on social media can boost disaster response significantly. Despite extensive research that mainly focuses on textual content to extract useful information, limited work has focused on the use of imagery content or the combination of both content types. One of the reasons is the lack of labeled imagery data in this domain. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to tackle this limitation by releasing a large multimodal dataset collected from Twitter during different natural disasters. We provide three types of annotations, which are useful to address a number of crisis response and management tasks for different humanitarian organizations.},

One of the more successful data augmentations strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also experiment with GANs to generate images of different styles.

Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance. Our extensive evaluation scenarios show that machine translation systems are approaching a good level of maturity and that they can, in combination to appropriate machine learning algorithms and carefully chosen features, be used to build sentiment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.},

This results in an improved digital map of the risk of human exposure to tick-borne diseases in Trentino (Italian Alps) given sampling on 388 sites and the use of several overlaying georeferenced data bases. Margin distributions are compared for bagging and boosting. Boosting is confirmed to give the most accurate model on two additional and independent test sets of reported cases of bites on humans and of infestation measured on roe deer. An interesting feature of combining classification models within a GIS is the visualization through maps of the single elements of the combination: each boosting step map focuses on different details of data distribution.

  title = {Pattern {{Recognition}} and {{Machine Learning}}},
  isbn = {978-0-387-31073-2},
  abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted. Coming soon: *For students, worked solutions to a subset of exercises available on a public web site (for exercises marked "www" in the text) *For instructors, worked solutions to remaining exercises from the Springer web site *Lecture slides to accompany each chapter *Data sets available for download},

  title = {An Analysis of {{Twitter}} Messages in the 2011 {{Tohoku Earthquake}}},
  volume = {91},
  abstract = {Social media such as Facebook and Twitter have proven to be a useful resource to understand public opinion towards real world events. In this paper, we investigate over 1.5 million Twitter messages (tweets) for the period 9th March 2011 to 31st May 2011 in order to track awareness and anxiety levels in the Tokyo metropolitan district to the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and subsequent tsunami and nuclear emergencies. These three events were tracked using both English and Japanese tweets. Preliminary results indicated: 1) close correspondence between Twitter data and earthquake events, 2) strong correlation between English and Japanese tweets on the same events, 3) tweets in the native language play an important roles in early warning, 4) tweets showed how quickly Japanese people's anxiety returned to normal levels after the earthquake event. Several distinctions between English and Japanese tweets on earthquake events are also discussed. The results suggest that Twitter data can be used as a useful resource for tracking the public mood of populations affected by natural disasters as well as an early warning system.},
