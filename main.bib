Flood risk is increasing due to urban growth, which makes people more vulnerable and threatens economic assets, and due to factors that increase flood hazard, including reduced delta aggradation, subsidence though natural resource extraction, and climate change, including extreme weather events, such as typhoons, and sea level rise. The recent history of flooding in Asia's deltaic cities and the drivers of that risk have been examined in this article. We give particular attention to the Pearl River Delta, and its cities of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Shenzhen, important economic centres of Asia. The flood risk is substantial, but flood risk management appear to suffer through a lack of sufficient strategic planning, and the difficulty of defending deltaic cities through traditional engineering approaches alone. Drawing on lessons from flood risk management internationally, we suggest that there are ways forward in developing flood mitigation strategies for deltaic cities in the region, which deserve further exploration.},

Hereby, availability of information and effective communication is of utmost importance. Efficient support for first responders and decision makers, coordinating the assignments, is necessary to save time and lives, as many victims might not survive long without appropriate assistance. Context-aware computing and adequate HCI can be key factors, supporting first responders as well as decision makers in their difficult tasks. This position paper discusses preliminary thoughts on basic questions relevant to the design of HCI for emergency management. A short overview of the challenges of HCI in emergency scenarios is given. Some implications of these challenges, the need for context-aware user interfaces as well as the careful design of interaction methods and devices are discussed briefly.},

Natural disasters are generally classified into three major groups (CRED, 2009): (i) `geophysical disasters' (e.g., earthquake, volcanic eruption, rockfall, landslide, avalanche, and subsidence); (ii) `hydro-meteorological disasters' (e.g., flood, drought, storm, extreme temperature, wildfire, and wet mass movement); and (iii) `biological disasters' (e.g., epidemic, insect infestation, and animal stampede). Similarly, anthropogenic disasters are broadly classified into two major groups (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster): (i) `technological disasters' (e.g., disasters due to engineering failures, transport disasters, and environmental disasters); and (ii) `sociological disasters' (e.g., criminal acts, riots, war, stampedes, etc.).},

  abstract = {Disaster Management (DM) is a complex set of interrelated activities. The activities are often knowledge intensive and time sensitive. Sharing the required knowledge timely is critical for DM. In developed countries, for recurring disasters (e.g. floods), there are dedicated document repositories of Disaster Management Plans (DMP) that can be accessed as needs arise. However, accessing the appropriate plan in a timely manner and sharing activities between plans often requires domain knowledge and intimate knowledge of the plans in the first place. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based knowledge analysis method to convert DMPs into a collection of knowledge units that can be stored into a unified repository. The repository of DM actions then enables the mixing and matching knowledge between different plans. The repository is structured as a layered abstraction according to Meta Object Facility (MOF). We use the flood management plans used by SES in NSW to illustrate and give a preliminary validation of the approach. It is illustrated using DMPs along the flood prone Murrumbidgee River in central NSW.},

@phdthesis{yangUrbanFloodSimulation,
  title = {Urban {{Flood Simulation}} and {{Integrated Flood Risk Management}}},
  abstract = {Climate change induces the probability of occurring natural disasters; e.g.
floods, Sea Level Rise, Green House Gases. Flood is considered one of the
most dangerous phenomena that tremendously and dramatically threatening
the human being and environment worldwide. Rapid urban growth,
demographic explosion, and unplanned land uses have exacerbated the
problem of urban flooding, particularly in the cities of China. In addition to that,
the concept of flood risk management and adaptation measures and strategies
are still missed in the cities' development future plans.
The main objective of this Ph.D. dissertation is to investigate the flood risk
analysis and assessment based on flood simulation and adaptive strategies for
flood event through two case studies of Changsha city in south-central China.
In case study I, fluvial flooding was considered on mesoscale and an MCAbased
approach was proposed to assess the integrated flood risk of Changsha
central city. HEC-RAS 1-D model was used to simulation the inundation
characteristics for hazard analysis based on four risk dimensions: economic,
social, environmental, and infrastructural risk. For infrastructural dimension,
apart for direct damage on road segments, network analysis method was
combined with inundation information and macroscopic traffic simulation to
evaluate the impact on traffic volume as well as a decrease of road service level.
Closeness centrality weighted with a travel time of pre- and after- flood was
compared in order to measure the impact on urban accessibility. Integrated risk
values were calculated using various weighting criteria sets. Sobol' indices were
used as a tool of spatially-explicit global Uncertainty Analysis and Sensitivity
Analysis (UA/SA) for damage models.
In case study II, an agent-based modeling approach was proposed to simulate
the emergency pluvial flood event caused by a short-time rainstorm in local
areas of cities aiming at developing an interactive flood emergency
management system capable of interpreting the risk and reduction strategy of
the pluvial flood. The simulation integrated an inundation model with
microscopic traffic simulation. It also reveals that all agents can benefit
significantly from both engineering measures and the only pedestrian obtain
relatively more benefits from risk warning with high awareness. The method
provided potentials in studies on the adaptive emergency management and risk
reduction, help both decision-makers and stakeholders to acquire deeper and
comprehensive understanding of the flood risk.
IV
This Ph.D. study has investigated holistic methods and models' selection in
flood risk assessment and management to overcome data deficiency and to
achieve the integration of different data. The results of the first case study reveal
that the integrated methods have proved to be able to improved flood risk
analysis and assessment especially for indirect damage of infrastructural
system with network features. The global UA/SA based on Sobol' method and
visualization with maps enable to gain the spatial distribution of uncertainty for
various factors, the validation of damage models, and deeper and more
comprehensive understanding of flood risk. Then based on the integrated risk
assessment, functions of spatial planning in flood risk management were
discussed, potentially providing guidance and support for decision-making.
The results of the second case study denote that agent-based modeling and
simulation can be effectively utilized for flood emergency management. Two
scenarios focusing on specific risk reduction interventions were designed and
compared. Engineering measures by improving capability of the drainage
system and the surface permeability of waterlogging areas are the most
effective means for damage mitigation. High public risk awareness still has
great potential benefits of the in the event of emergencies, which can greatly
enhance the effectiveness of the official warning. The agent-based modeling
and simulation provided an effective method for analyzing the effectiveness of
different strategies for reducing flood risk at the local scale and for supporting
urban flood emergency management. The case studies also indicate the
significance and necessity of establishing a platform and database to realize
full sharing and synergies of spatial information resources for flood risk
management, which is a vital issue to manage the urban flood risk and take
effective measures correspondingly with responding to emergency extreme
flood event.},

  abstract = {Many coastal cities are experiencing growing risk to hydrological hazards through the combination of uncontrolled urban development and exposure to natural phenomena linked to climate change, including rising sea levels, intensified storms, and amplified storm surges. This growing risk is particularly acute in Asian coastal mega-cities, many of which have yet to develop adequate adaptation policies to address plausible impacts of climate change. In this analysis, we review how Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the most affluent coastal cities in East Asia, have initiated many flood mitigation strategies policies that have allowed them to reduce the impacts flooding. These strategies, once relying largely on building flood control structures, have now evolved to include holistic flood risk management approaches that include socio-economic factors. Arguably these two success stories provide inspiration for other coastal Asian cities. However, as climate change and uncontrolled development are likely to increase urban flooding in the future, general improvements could be made to improve knowledge transfer: e.g., develop means to work across policy silos and strike compromises between conflicting sectoral responsibilities, and develop long-term integrated strategies using planning tools and practices to address growing risk. While knowledge transfer cannot be direct because of different geographical settings, socio-economic situations, and political situations, we encourage governments to look beyond engineering-based flood control structures as to develop flood governance programs.},

Professionals associated with disaster management and climate change are at the forefront of addressing urban flooding. To reduce flood risks, vulnerability and its components must be understood. Vulnerability assessment methods are diverse and complex, with a varied nature of understanding the key terms used in various contexts, and this diversity ultimately reflects on the interpretation of results in research settings. Diverse interpretations and definitions exist in the disaster risk and climate change literature, complicating the process of astute and comprehensive vulnerability assessment. The main purpose of this study was to quantify vulnerability indicators and develop a multidimensional model for vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability is explored through the lens of five dimensions: social, economic, physical/infrastructural, institutional, and attitudinal. This methodology is applied to urban flooding in Pakistan, to verify the proposed model. Three study sites in urban areas with different population sizes, situated in high-risk flood zones in the Punjab Province of Pakistan were selected for empirical investigation. A household survey was conducted, and indices were developed for each dimension based on well-defined indicators. The proposed methodology for vulnerability assessment was tested and found operational. This method can be replicated irrespective of spatial scales and can be modified for other disasters by streamlining hazard specific indicators.},

This ``transition to decision making'' (TDM) concept was analyzed through a structured interview survey of 25 current and former US Federal Coordinating Officers (FCOs) and focused on their decision-making process during the initial response period in a Presidentially declared Stafford Act disaster. This analysis suggests that the TDM for these emergency leaders is influenced by the following five factors: 1) Analogue Factor: the decision maker's previous knowledge and experience from analogous disaster situations; 2) New Paradigm Factor: the degree to which the disaster situation is very atypical to the decision maker due to hazard type and/or situation severity, 3) Data Capture Factor: the quality, amount, and speed of disaster situation data conveyed to the decision maker; 4) Data Integration Factor: the decision maker's ability to integrate situational data elements into a mental framework/picture; and 5) Time Urgency Factor: the decision maker's perception as to time available before a decision has to be made. The article describes the factors and graphs that how these may influence the timing of the TDM in four types of emergency situations faced by FCOs: 1) an analogue disaster, 2) a disaster situation that presents a new paradigm, 3) an intuitive disaster situation, and 4) a disaster requiring an urgent response.},

A significant portion of that shortfall can be covered by savings attained by eliminating non-public-good services, initiating public-private partnerships for meeting peak time demand in emergency situations, and contracting-out other public services. We concentrate on such savings in the context of response to false calls to police, fire, and ambulance services. Solving the false alarm problem for police, fire, and ambulance services and eliminating some non-public-good police services could release significant service-hours and 23.7-31.4\% of the required additional Homeland Security (HLS) annual spending. Reducing false alarms means 88,000 police, fire, and ambulance first responders could be shifted to HLS activities.},

As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: handling information overload, filtering credible information, and prioritizing different classes of messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages, focusing on their application in emergency response scenarios. We examine the particularities of this setting, and then methodically examine a series of key sub-problems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries.},

volumes of data nowadays. The use of this information in natural hazard research is an important issue. Particularly useful
for risk assessment and decision making are the spatial maps of hazard-related parameters produced from point observations
and available auxiliary information. The purpose of this article is to present and explore the appropriate tools to process
large amounts of available data and produce predictions at fine spatial scales. These are the algorithms of machine learning,
which are aimed at non-parametric robust modelling of non-linear dependencies from empirical data. The computational efficiency
of the data-driven methods allows producing the prediction maps in real time which makes them superior to physical models
for the operational use in risk assessment and mitigation. Particularly, this situation encounters in spatial prediction of
climatic variables (topo-climatic mapping). In complex topographies of the mountainous regions, the meteorological processes
are highly influenced by the relief. The article shows how these relations, possibly regionalized and non-linear, can be modelled
from data using the information from digital elevation models. The particular illustration of the developed methodology concerns
the mapping of temperatures (including the situations of F{\"o}hn and temperature inversion) given the measurements taken from
the Swiss meteorological monitoring network. The range of the methods used in the study includes data-driven feature selection,
support vector algorithms and artificial neural networks.},

Despite similarities in their high-level goals, approach, and geographies served, the systems have key differences in their use of technology, their level of transparency, and their relationship to government. Using qualitative interviews, field immersions, and other data, we analyze how these differences impact the experiences of citizens, officials, and the intermediaries between them.

The new framework incorporates Box\textendash{}Cox transformations, Fourier representations with time varying coefficients, and ARMA error correction. Likelihood evaluation and analytical expressions for point forecasts and interval predictions under the assumption of Gaussian errors are derived, leading to a simple, comprehensive approach to forecasting complex seasonal time series. A key feature of the framework is that it relies on a new method that greatly reduces the computational burden in the maximum likelihood estimation. The modeling framework is useful for a broad range of applications, its versatility being illustrated in three empirical studies. In addition, the proposed trigonometric formulation is presented as a means of decomposing complex seasonal time series, and it is shown that this decomposition leads to the identification and extraction of seasonal components which are otherwise not apparent in the time series plot itself.},

This paper conducts a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques, exploring different deep architectures and comparing them on a common ground, identifying and disclosing important implementation details. We identify several useful properties of CNN-based representations, including the fact that the dimensionality of the CNN output layer can be reduced significantly without having an adverse effect on performance. We also identify aspects of deep and shallow methods that can be successfully shared. In particular, we show that the data augmentation techniques commonly applied to CNN-based methods can also be applied to shallow methods, and result in an analogous performance boost.

Damage assessment during disasters is a core situational awareness task for many humanitarian organizations that traditionally takes weeks and months. In this work, we analyze images posted on social media platforms during natural disasters to determine the level of damage caused by the disasters. We employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to perform an extensive experimentation of damage assessment using images from four major natural disasters. We show that the domain-specific fine-tuning of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques such as Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW). High classification accuracy under both event-specific and cross-event test settings demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively adapt deep-CNN features to identify the severity of destruction from social media images taken after a disaster strikes.},

  abstract = {This work focuses on the analysis of Italian social media messages for disaster management and aims at the detection of messages carrying critical information for the damage assessment task. A main novelty of this study consists in the focus on out-domain and cross-event damage detection, and on the investigation of the most relevant tweet-derived features for these tasks. We devised different experiments by resorting to a wide set of linguistic features qualifying the lexical and grammatical structure of a text as well as ad-hoc features specifically implemented for this task. We investigated the most effective features that allow to achieve the best results. A further result of this study is the construction of the first manually annotated Italian corpus of social media messages for damage assessment.},
