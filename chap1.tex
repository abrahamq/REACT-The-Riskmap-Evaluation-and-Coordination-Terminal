\chapter{Introduction} Disasters triggered by natural hazards are a constant
threat to societies all over the planet. Among those disasters, flooding is the
most common calamity in the world, accounting for half of all disaster
deaths~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012, ohlFloodingHumanHealth2000}.
Although flooding impacts both developed and developing countries, developing
nations face much higher mortality rates as a result of flooding since they lack
resources to adequately mitigate
hazards~\cite{quarantelliUrbanVulnerabilityDisasters2003,
ahernGlobalHealthImpacts2005}. Deltaic megacities in developing countries are
particularly at risk because of unregulated urbanization, rising population, and
climate change~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012}.  Moreover, there is little data
that is available before, during, and after a disaster to help stakeholders
respond to hazards~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}.

%% TODO: this is pretty disjointed
Various stakeholders, such as humanitarian Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs),
government emergency responders and affected citizens, have different but
overlapping interests with regards to disaster management.  Government and NGOs
work together to provide relief and mitigate damages from
flooding~\cite{chanResilientFloodRisk2018}, while citizens
look for relevant information and try to reduce their
risk by avoiding heavily affected
areas~\cite{viewegMicrobloggingTwoNatural2010}. Information is at the core of
disaster management; however, data scarcity makes it hard for emergency
personnel to optimize their use of resources, while citizens have an abundance
of information about their surroundings but must be careful not to trust
incorrect or outdated information about broader
areas~\cite{quarantelliProblematicalAspectsInformation1997}.

Disaster information systems can connect affected communities with
Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), thereby bridging the information gap
between responders and citizens. Many such disaster information systems have
been developed, but they often suffer from a lack of institutional
buy-in~\cite{aminDataNaturalDisasters2008}. The lack of engagement can be partly
attributed to the difficulty of adding data gathering responsibilities to
emergency personnel that have little time during crises. One solution to this
problem is asking citizens to submit information to allow for peer to peer and
citizen to govenment information
sharing~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}; however, crowdsourcing brings
its own issue: in times of crisis EOCs can suffer from information overload when
they are presented with too much
data~\cite{tierneyFacingUnexpectedDisaster2001}. 

The REACT System is built on top of the Riskmap Platform for crowdsourcing
disaster information\footnote{REACT is libre software and can be found
\href{http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3374994}{here}}.
REACT uses novel machine learning research to reduce information overload from
crowd sourced data in EOCs, thereby decreasing data
analysis time during disasters. It first extracts key features from each of
the parts of a report (text, picture, metadata) using domain specific techniques
and then uses an ensemble learner to classify the citizen report.

First we establish the motivation for using citizens as sensors and provide an
overview of the Riskmap System which allows for gathering of citizen reports. We
then show the need for analyzing this noisy data using machine learning. A
review of different machine learning techniques that have been used in crisis
information systems, including those that also utilize social media is
presented.  Finally we describe REACT, a novel ensemble learning model that can
accurately predict large urban flood events from noisy crowdsourced data.
