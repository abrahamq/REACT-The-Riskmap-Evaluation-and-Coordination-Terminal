\chapter{Introduction} Flooding is the most common natural disaster in the
world~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012}.  Flood related deaths account for half of
all deaths from natural disasters~\cite{ohlFloodingHumanHealth2000}. Although
flooding impacts both developed and developing countries, developing nations
face much worse consequences as a result of flooding since they lack resources
to adequately mitigate
hazards~\cite{quarantelliUrbanVulnerabilityDisasters2003}. Deltaic megacities
in developing countries are particularly at risk because of unregulated
urbanization, rising population and climate change are increasing the rate at
which floods occur~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012}. In
addition to the increase in disaster risk, there is little data that is
available before, during, and after a disaster to help stakeholders mitigate
hazards~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}. Data scarcity makes it hard to
pinpoint where to direct aid during disasters and where to make infrastructure
improvements after disasters~\cite{ranaMultidimensionalModelVulnerability2018}.

%% TODO: this is pretty disjointed
Various stakeholders have different but overlapping interests with regards to
disaster management. Government and NGOs work together to provide relief and
mitigate damages from flooding~\cite{chanResilientFloodRisk2018}, while Citizens
look for relevant flood information and try to reduce their
risk~\cite{viewegMicrobloggingTwoNatural2010}. Information is at the core of
this interaction; however, data scarcity makes it hard for emergency personnel
to optimize their use of resources, while citizens have an abundance of
information about their surroundings but must be careful not to trust incorrect
or outdated information about broader
areas~\cite{quarantelliProblematicalAspectsInformation1997}. The natural
solution is for citizens on social media to submit real time reports to the
Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which is tasked with using those reports to
inform citizens.  There is one problem with this solution, in times of crisis
EOCs can suffer from information overload when they are presented with too much
information~\cite{tierneyFacingUnexpectedDisaster2001}.

The REACT system uses novel machine learning and human computer interaction
research to reduce information overload in EOCs, thereby decreasing disaster
response time. REACT classifies reports as indicating heavy flooding or not
through an ensemble model. It first extracts key features from each of the parts
of a report (text, picture, metadata) using known techniques and then uses a
small dense neural net to classify the citizen report.

%% TODO I feel like I'm restating myself here?
\section{Emerging Risk In South and Southeast Asia} Global climate change is
`expected to increase the frequency and intensity of
floods'~\cite{ahernGlobalHealthImpacts2005}.  Urban areas are particularly at
risk from flooding; unchecked development and rising population have created
megacities that regularly experience flooding~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012}.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in South and Southeast Asia, where the
severity of floods has been increasing over the past several
decades~\cite{tortiFloodsSoutheastAsia2012}.

Of the world's 33 megacities, over 60 percent are located in developing Asian
Countries~\cite{unitednationsdepartmentofeconomicandsocialaffairsWorldCities20162016}.
These cities face a looming crisis as flood risk increases, but there are also
unique opportunities for risk mitigation. Megacities are characterized by high
population density. This high density leads to an increase in economic damages
and loss of life, but it also means that there are large numbers of citizens
that have disaster information they would like to share with
others~\cite{chanFloodRiskAsia2012}.

\section{History of Disaster Informatics} One of the best known and earliest
work in mapping disasters was John Snow's use of maps to find the
source of the 1857 Cholera outbreak in London\cite{rogersJohnSnowData2013}. This
example is generally taught to all new students of epidemiology and illustrates
the need not only for up to date information, but for systems that ease the
analysis of this information. In John Snow's case, the map was the tool that
allowed him to visualize the spread of the disease and effectively take action
that ended the outbreak.

In more recent times, the need for Information Technology (IT) in disaster
management has been clear since the mid 1980s when computers became user
friendly enough to be used during
disasters~\cite{universityTerminalDisastersComputer1986}. Now many EOCs use
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), inventory control systems, and online
messaging systems among other technology in order to organize spatial data and
analyze disaster information. While some systems have helped some regions to
better respond to disasters, researchers have often stated that `there
are many reasons to remain skeptical about the idea that technology will provide
a panacea for emergency management problems'~\cite{tzemosUseGISFederal1995,
tierneyFacingUnexpectedDisaster2001, perryNaturalDisasterManagement2007}. A
number of potential negative effects associated with disaster management
technology have been identified: the potential for the technology to increase
social inequality, the potential of information overload, and the dissemination
of incorrect and outdated information~\cite{quarantelliProblematicalAspectsInformation1997,
flentgeDesigningContextAwareHCI}.

\subsection{Social Media and Disasters}
%% TODO is this in the right place??
The history of social media and the
hashtag is invariably linked to disaster communication.  It was during the San
Diego bush fires of 2007 that the hashtag was first widely used on
twitter~\cite{salazarHashtagsAnnotatedHistory2017}.

Much work has been done in passively listening to social media streams
in order to better understand how disasters unfold and how humans use
social media as a communication tool during disaster events. Many of
these studies use hand labeled tweets in order to analyze which
percentage of them 

Digital Humanitarians use twitter to help spatially locate needs in
Haiti after the 2008 earthquake~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}

Twitter tale of 3 hurricanes~\cite{alamTwitterTaleThree2018}

Quarantelli emphaszied that  `management of hazards is fundamentally social in
nature and not something that can be achieved strictly through technological
upgrading'~\cite{tierneyFacingUnexpectedDisaster2001} yet social media brings
human behavior into a machine readable format that can be used to provide
further information during disasters.

\subsection{Crowdsourcing vs. Passive Listening}
\begin{quote}
	\textit{Since humanitarian organizations
	don't ask eyewitnesses on social media to report information on needs
	and impact groups like the Red Cross have to rely on witnesses sharing
	relevant information by chance.}
		\begin{flushright}
		--- Patrick Meier~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}
		\end{flushright}
\end{quote}

As Patrick Meier points out in \textit{Digital Humanitarians}, passively
listening to twitter data streams and hoping that someone posts relevant
disaster information is not always a winning strategy. One solution to this
problem is to have paid workers that collect information and enter it into
disaster information systems as in~\cite{aminDataNaturalDisasters2008}, which
details how paid workers were used to input data from citizens during the
Mozambique floods of 2007; however, this method is expensive and does not scale
well. The same report states that `data processing and consolidation [were]
difficult' and that `the few data entry clerks struggled to keep
up'~\cite{aminDataNaturalDisasters2008}.

\section{The Riskmap System}\label{chap1:riskmap}

	\subsection{Need for open data}
	Creating bespoke information systems at the beginning of disasters has been the
	norm~\cite{aminDataNaturalDisasters2008}; however this
	means that disaster response organizations must become acclimated with the
	system at the same time that they are dealing with disaster situations. 
	
	There have been some notable projects that attempt to provide complete systems
	that can be used for different disasters. Most notably are the Sahana and the
	AIDR projects.

	Sahana has suspended its disaster response project that helped to
	mobilize volunteers to respond to disasters.
	// not focusing enough on the HCI and hidden wiring?
	
	On the need of opening up crowdsourced emergency systems~\cite{avvenutiNeedOpeningCrowdsourced2018a}

    \subsection{System overview}
    The  Framework alleviates the load on emergency managers by centralizing reports from many sources. It also makes it easy not only for reports to come into the response center, but also for emergency managers to indicate which areas of a city are most affected at any one time. The data gathered during an event is persistent and available under the Creative Commons license, which allows researchers to track the flood over time and pinpoint areas that are particularly vulnerable to flooding. 

\section{Conquering Information Overload}
	It is not enough to create an advanced system for consuming citizen
	reports, it is also necessary to ensure that this system does not
	consume resources that are already scarce during a disaster event, for
	example the time of emergency
	workers~\cite{aminDataNaturalDisasters2008}. If analyzing data takes too
	much time, then decision makers will make decisions without having fully
	analyzed the data~\cite{quarantelliUrbanVulnerabilityDisasters2003}

	Using computers to automatically make sense of disaster data has long
	been a goal in disaster informatics, but only recently have machine
	learning techniques become good enough to be implemented in production
	emergency systems~\cite{meierDigitalHumanitariansHow2015}. Image
	recognition algorithms can provide summaries of objects and scenes found
	in user submitted photos~\cite{nguyenRapidClassificationCrisisRelated,
	donahueDeCAFDeepConvolutional2013}. Natural language processing can
	estimate the probability that a textual document is overall negative or positive
	and thereby give EOCs a shorthand way to summarize thousands of reports
	in short amounts of time~\cite{nguyenRapidClassificationCrisisRelated,
	nagyCrowdSentimentDetection2012}. Finally, ensemble learning methods can
	learn relationships between disparate datasets and synthesize a single
	result~\cite{mouzannarDamageIdentificationSocial2018}.
